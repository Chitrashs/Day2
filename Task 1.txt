write a blog to differentiate document and window objects

Document Object:

The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects,
we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document

Window Object:

The window object represents an open window in a browser. If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags),
the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

Difference:

The “Document Object” represents a webpage structure that is inserted in the DOM tree hierarchy and when compiled the content gets displayed on the webpage.
By getting access to the document object, the users can access the HTML webpage content along with the elements by which the webpage is built. 
On the other hand, the “Window Object” is at the head position of the DOM hierarchy showing a window browser or frame..
